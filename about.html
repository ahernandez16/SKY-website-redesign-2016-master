                <h2>Who We Are</h2>
                <p>The brotherhood of Sigma Kappa Psi is a fraternity open to all students of Cornell College. It strives to maintain the strong ideals of Integrity, Positive Change, Service, and Leadership. The members of Sigma Kappa Psi reflect the meaning of the group’s name: strength, perseverance, and righteousness. The members show strength and perseverance by standing up for their beliefs and values; the members reflect righteousness by being an example to others through their virtues and positive morals. Sigma Kappa Psi exists so its members can strive and excel in both on campus and off campus activities. The brotherhood also wants to provide strong relationships and an excellent support system for all of our members.</p>

                <h2>Our Values &amp; Beliefs</h2>
                <p>Sigma Kappa Psi believes in creating and promoting positive change and realizes that improvements can be made in the communities of Cornell and Mount Vernon. The brotherhood strives to bring these improvements by setting a positive example and being not only dependable and responsible men, but also be good leaders and have high standards to strive for. Bringing about change implies having a proactive attitude. This attitude not only consists of an eagerness to be involved, but also the knowledge that the group’s involvement brings about positive change.</p>
<p>A key institution in the implementation of change is service. Through service the group not only accomplishes the desired change, but also brings about closer relationships on the individual, group, and community level. It is the group’s hope that the brotherhood’s dedication to service shall encourage others to become involved.</p>
<p>To ensure the group’s example of being dependable and responsible men and upholding the group’s ideals, strong inner group relationships and one’s individual integrity must be genuinely present. This integrity is shown by members being responsible for their actions, being reliable and trustworthy, and being respectful of all individuals.</p>
<p>The tenets of SKY were chosen to uphold and reflect the beliefs of its members. Leadership, the last tenet, is integral to the group’s philosophy and essential to members’ success at Cornell and beyond. The brothers strive to be strong and effective leaders through involvement in various campus and community activities. SKY seeks to empower its individuals to become better men of Cornell, the community, and the world.</p>
